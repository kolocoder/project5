## Notes

How to get user input:
I used an EditText to let users type in the pet's weight.
How to add choices:
I used a Spinner to let users pick the type of pet (Dog, Cat, Rabbit).
I used RadioButtons so the user can pick how active their pet is (Low, Medium, High).
How to use a button:
I added a Button that does the calculation when clicked.
How to show the result:
I used a TextView to show how much food the pet needs every day.
How to write the logic in Kotlin:
I wrote a function that checks what pet and activity level the user picked, then calculates the food based on that.
